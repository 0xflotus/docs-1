# Tutorials

## Template Overview

In this tutorial we go through the default Vue template to gain an understanding of how Wails works. It is a simple introduction to some of the core concepts of the framework.

## Quote Generator

Building on the default template, we create a Quotes Generator. This introduces the concepts of binding a struct to your application as well as interacting with the Wails runtime in Go.

This is recommended for those who are proficient in Javascript and Go and are looking to quickly create an app. It builds on the Template Tutorial so it is recommended to complete that first.

## Todo

What's a framework without a Todo app? We revisit the classic app, basing it on the [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/vue/) version.

This is a comprehensive and advanced tutorial that only requires a basic knowledge of Javascript and Go. It covers all aspects of Wails and is recommended for people of all skill levels.
